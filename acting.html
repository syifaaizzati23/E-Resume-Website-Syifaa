    <p>
       
I was first introduced to theatre during my first semester when I joined an audition. Since I have always been comfortable with performing arts, I decided to spend my free time pursuing my passion for acting. During my studies at UiTM Merbok, I had the opportunity to perform in three theatre productions: Mahsuri, Magika, and Sisa Kasih.

Being part of the Kelab Artis Budaya Warisan opened the door for me to learn more about the performing arts industry. Besides acting techniques, we were also exposed to backstage management and how to organize a performance or program. Through this experience, I gained not only knowledge as a Library and Information Management student, but also valuable insights from the performing arts field.

These experiences have strengthened my social skills and communication skills, and have helped me become more confident in interacting and working with others.
